      "problem": "Agriculture generates 931 million tons of waste annually including crop residues, coconut husks, and rice straw that are often burned, releasing carbon and pollutants. Single-use plastics in agriculture (mulch films, packaging, drip lines) consume 4 million tons of petroleum annually and contaminate soil. Decomposition takes 400+ years, and microplastic accumulation impairs soil biology. Farmers lack economically viable alternatives that match conventional plastic performance and availability.",
      "solution": "We've developed bioplastics from agricultural waste streams (corn stover, sugarcane bagasse, rice husks) using proprietary fermentation and polymer synthesis. Our materials match or exceed conventional plastic performance in tensile strength, UV resistance, and water vapor barriers while degrading within 2 years in soil without toxic residues. We've created supply partnerships with 200+ farms, ensuring consistent feedstock. Agricultural bioplastics command 15-20% premium pricing due to sustainability certification, improving farm economics while eliminating soil contamination.",

      "title": "Water Membrane Regeneration",
      "problem": "Industrial wastewater treatment consumes 3-4 kWh per cubic meter of water processed. Reverse osmosis membranes become fouled within 1-2 years, requiring replacement at $50,000+ per installation. Membrane disposal adds 20% to treatment costs, and most facilities lack recovery infrastructure. Discarded membranes end up in landfills despite containing recoverable materials. Industry-wide, 100 million membranes are replaced annually, yet only 5% are recycled. Water scarcity affects 2 billion people, yet 80% of treated wastewater is unused.",
      "solution": "Our regeneration system cleans fouled membranes using low-energy enzymatic and mechanical processes, extending membrane lifespan by 4-5x. We've reduced replacement frequency from annual to every 5 years, cutting treatment costs by 65%. Our system recovers 95% of membrane material for reuse or manufacturing. Treated water is polished through our multi-stage system achieving 99.5% purity suitable for industrial reuse or environmental discharge. A single installation serves 500,000 people while reducing wastewater treatment energy consumption by 50%.",

Coffee waste represents 50% of coffee bean mass but is typically discarded or used minimally. Current applications capture <5% of generated waste, leaving 19 million tons in landfills where they decompose over 8+ years. Hospitality waste streams remain largely untapped despite consistent volume and composition predictability that enables scalable recovery solutions.",
      "solution": "We've commercialized coffee waste conversion into three product lines: (1) activated carbon for air/water filtration, (2) compostable bioplastics and packaging materials, (3) nutrient-dense fertilizer for agriculture. Our process recovers 85% of coffee waste mass in usable form. We've partnered with 500+ cafes providing collection infrastructure, creating revenue streams for hospitality businesses. Our activated carbon matches commercial performance at 30% lower cost. Annual capacity now processes 50,000 tons, preventing 50,000 tons CO2 equivalent emissions and generating $8 million in product revenue.",

Tire stockpiles occupy 14 million tons globally, creating fire hazards and mosquito breeding grounds. Current recycling methods (grinding for rubberized asphalt) use 80% of recovered tire material while recovering only 20%. Pyrolysis technology exists but lacks scalable economics due to high energy costs and uncertain product markets. Recovered materials (carbon black, oil, steel) have lower value than virgin alternatives.",
      "solution": "We've developed an integrated pyrolysis system that processes whole tires without shredding, reducing energy consumption by 60% vs. conventional pyrolysis. Our process recovers: (1) 25% fuel-grade pyrolysis oil, (2) 45% carbon black for tire manufacturing and composites, (3) 20% steel for metal recycling, (4) 10% syngas for system energy. Our facility processes 20,000 tires/day with full automation. Carbon black quality matches virgin material, commanding 90% of virgin pricing while using 100% waste feedstock. Economic recovery of $180/ton tire enables profitable circular operations.",
