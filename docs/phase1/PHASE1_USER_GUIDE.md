# 📊 New Feature: Benchmarking & Gap Analysis

## What's New?

Your scoring report now includes **comprehensive benchmarking** that shows how your circular economy project compares to similar real-world projects in our database.

## Three New Sections in Your Report

### 1. 🎯 **Your Performance vs. Similar Projects** (After Executive Summary)

See four key metrics:

- **Your Score** - What you scored in this assessment
- **Similar Projects Average** - How similar projects typically score
- **Top 10% Threshold** - What top performers achieve
- **Median** - The typical midpoint score

**What it tells you:**

- If your score is above average, you're doing better than most
- The "Top 10% Threshold" shows what's possible
- Large gaps indicate room for improvement

### 2. 📈 **Factor-by-Factor Analysis** (In Same Card)

For each of the 8 evaluation factors, see:

- Your score vs. the benchmark
- The gap (how many points you're above/below)
- Your percentile ranking

**Color coding:**

- 🟢 **Green checkmark** = You're above benchmark (strength)
- 🟠 **Orange arrow** = Below benchmark (opportunity)

**Example:**

> "Infrastructure: Your score 65 vs. Benchmark 72 | Opportunity: +7 points possible | 45th percentile"

### 3. 🏷️ **Project Classification** (At Bottom)

Your project is automatically classified:

- **Industry** - What sector (packaging, energy, agriculture, etc.)
- **Scale** - Micro, small, medium, or large operation
- **Strategy** - Which circular economy approach (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, etc.)
- **Primary Material** - What waste stream you focus on
- **Geographic Focus** - Your main market region

**Why it matters:**

- Helps us find the most relevant comparable projects
- Shows the system understands your business context
- Foundation for future industry-specific recommendations

## How This Helps

### For Your Business

- **Benchmark Against Reality** - Not against arbitrary standards, but actual projects
- **Identify Improvement Areas** - See which factors need attention
- **Set Realistic Targets** - Know what top performers achieve
- **Understand Your Position** - See where you rank among peers

### Example Scenario

> You score 72 overall
>
> - Average similar project: 70
> - Top 10%: 85
> - Median: 68
>
> **Interpretation:**
>
> - ✅ You're above average - good fundamentals
> - 📈 13-point gap to top tier - clear growth path
> - 🎯 Median beats most, but top performers are within reach

## The Data Behind It

Benchmarks come from:

- Real projects in the **GreenTechGuardians database**
- Semantic similarity matching (finds truly comparable projects)
- Statistical aggregation (not subjective)
- **Continuously updates** as new projects are added

## Interpreting Your Gaps

### Small Gap (0-5 points)

You're performing at or near benchmark level for this factor. Focus on other areas.

### Medium Gap (6-15 points)

This is an opportunity area. Improvements here could significantly boost your overall score.

### Large Gap (16+ points)

Major opportunity. This factor is critical - addressing it would meaningfully improve your standing.

## Tips for Using This Information

1. **Prioritize High-Gap Factors** - Start with the biggest gaps
2. **Study Top Performers** - Click "View Full Details" to see what top-10% projects do differently
3. **Track Over Time** - Return with improvements to see your benchmark position change
4. **Share with Stakeholders** - Use benchmarks to justify investment in specific areas

## FAQ

### Q: Why am I seeing "no benchmarks"?

**A:** Our database doesn't have enough comparable projects yet. We use synthetic benchmarks based on project quality. As more projects are scored, real benchmarks will appear.

### Q: Can benchmarks change?

**A:** Yes! As new projects are added to the database, average benchmarks may shift. Your score stays the same, but your percentile ranking can improve if you're ahead of new additions.

### Q: How is my industry determined?

**A:** Our AI analyzes your problem and solution text to extract industry automatically. If it's incorrect, that won't affect your score - it only improves our benchmark comparisons.

### Q: Are these benchmarks final?

**A:** These are v1.0 benchmarks. We continuously refine them as:

- More projects are added
- Historical outcomes are tracked
- Regional variations are understood

### Q: What if I'm in a different country?

**A:** Benchmarks pool projects globally by default. Future versions will offer regional breakdowns if that becomes a significant factor.

## What's Next?

### Coming Soon (Phase 2)

- **Custom Benchmarks** - Filter by specific region/scale
- **Competitive Analysis** - See exactly what top 10% are doing
- **Scenario Modeling** - "What if I improved X?"
- **Export Reports** - Share detailed benchmarking analysis

### Future Enhancements (Phase 3)

- **Historical Tracking** - Watch your progress over time
- **Regional Insights** - Market-specific recommendations
- **Automated Alerts** - When benchmarks move
- **Peer Comparison** - Compare with specific similar projects

## Technical Details

The benchmarking system uses:

- **Vector embeddings** for semantic similarity
- **Statistical analysis** (percentiles, averages, distribution)
- **Industry classification** (11 sectors)
- **Synthetic benchmarks** when historical data is limited
- **Real-time calculation** (no latency impact)

## Questions or Feedback?

We'd love to hear how this benchmarking feature is helping!

Areas we're interested in:

- Are the classified industries accurate?
- Are gaps aligned with your expectations?
- What other comparisons would be helpful?
- Any confusing aspects?
